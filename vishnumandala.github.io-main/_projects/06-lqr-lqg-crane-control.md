## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of advanced control strategies for a crane system, specifically utilizing Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers. The primary objective is to achieve precise positioning of the crane's trolley while minimizing the oscillations of the suspended payloads. This is particularly challenging due to the system's inherent instability and oscillatory nature.

## System Modeling
The crane system is modeled as a cart (trolley) moving along a one-dimensional track with two suspended pendulums representing the payloads. The dynamic equations governing the system are derived using Lagrangian mechanics, resulting in a set of nonlinear differential equations. For controller design purposes, these equations are linearized around the equilibrium point where the pendulums hang vertically downward.

### Equations of Motion
The system's behavior is described by nonlinear equations of motion derived using Newtonian mechanics. These equations account for the translational motion of the cart and the rotational motion of the suspended loads.

### Linearization
To facilitate controller design, the nonlinear equations are linearized around the equilibrium point where the cart is at rest, and the loads hang vertically. This linearization simplifies the system into a state-space representation suitable for applying linear control techniques.

### State-Space Representation
The linearized system is expressed in state-space form as follows:

$$ 
\dot{x} = Ax + Bu 
$$

$$
y = Cx + Du
$$


Where:
- \( x \) is the state vector comprising the cart's position and velocity, and the angles and angular velocities of the pendulums.
- \( u \) is the control input (force applied to the cart).
- \( y \) is the output vector.
- \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) are matrices derived from the system parameters.

## Controllability and Observability Analysis

### Controllability Analysis
Controllability determines whether it's possible to move the system from any initial state to any desired final state using appropriate control inputs. For the linearized crane system, the controllability matrix is constructed and analyzed. The system is found to be controllable if the matrix has full rank, indicating that all state variables can be influenced by the control inputs.

### Observability Analysis
Observability assesses whether the system's internal states can be inferred from its outputs. By examining different output configurations, the observability matrix is constructed and analyzed. A full-rank observability matrix indicates that the system's states can be accurately estimated from the outputs.

## Controller Design

### Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
The LQR controller is designed to provide optimal state feedback control by minimizing a cost function that balances state errors and control effort. The cost function is defined as:

$$
J = \int_{0}^{\infty} (x^T Q x + u^T R u) dt
$$

Where:
- \( Q \) is a positive semi-definite matrix that penalizes state deviations.
- \( R \) is a positive definite matrix that penalizes control effort.

The optimal control law is given by:
$$
u = -K \hat{x}
$$
Where \( K \) is the gain matrix computed by solving the Riccati equation.

### Implementation of LQR
- **Defining State and Input Matrices (A and B)**: These matrices represent the system dynamics.
- **Choosing Weighting Matrices (Q and R)**: These matrices penalize state deviations and control efforts, respectively.
- **Computing Feedback Gain (K)**: Using the LQR algorithm, the optimal gain matrix K is determined.
- **Simulating System Response**: The closed-loop system's performance is evaluated through simulations.

### Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG)
In practical scenarios, not all states may be measurable, and measurements are often corrupted by noise. The LQG controller addresses this by combining the LQR controller with a Kalman filter, which estimates the system states from noisy measurements. The Kalman filter provides an optimal estimate of the state vector $ \hat{x} $, which is then used in the control law:

$$
u = -K \hat{x}
$$

This approach ensures robust performance even with partial and noisy state information.

### Luenberger Observer Design
For observable systems, a Luenberger observer is designed to estimate the internal states based on output measurements. The observer uses the system's outputs and a model of its dynamics to provide real-time state estimates, which are crucial for state-feedback control strategies.

### Implementation of LQG
- **Designing the Kalman Filter**: This filter estimates the system's states in the presence of noise.
- **Integrating LQR and Kalman Filter**: The controller uses state estimates from the Kalman filter to compute control inputs.
- **Simulating Closed-Loop Performance**: The effectiveness of the LQG controller is evaluated through simulations.

    m2 = 1.5;  % Mass of load 2
    L1 = 2.0;  % Cable length 1
    L2 = 2.5;  % Cable length 2
    g = 9.81;  % Gravity
    
    % State space matrices
    A = [0 1 0 0 0 0;
         g/L1 0 0 0 0 0;
         0 0 0 1 0 0;
         0 0 g/L2 0 0 0;
         0 0 0 0 0 1;
         0 0 0 0 0 0];
         
    B = [0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 1];
    C = eye(6);
    D = zeros(6,1);
end
```

## Simulation and Results
Simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the designed controllers. The system was subjected to various scenarios, including setpoint changes and external disturbances. Key performance metrics such as settling time, overshoot, and oscillation damping were analyzed.

### Key Findings
- **Oscillation Reduction**: The LQR controller effectively dampens payload oscillations, achieving a significant reduction in swing amplitude compared to uncontrolled scenarios.
- **Robustness**: The LQG controller maintains system stability and performance even with noisy measurements and unmeasured states.
- **Control Effort**: Both controllers operate within feasible control input limits, ensuring practical applicability.

## Conclusion
The implementation of LQR and LQG controllers for the crane system demonstrates the efficacy of modern control techniques in managing complex, oscillatory systems. The controllers achieve precise trolley positioning while minimizing payload sway, enhancing both safety and efficiency in crane operations. Extensive simulations confirm that both controllers effectively stabilize the crane system, with the LQG controller offering superior performance in the presence of noise.
